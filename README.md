### Project Title
Explore Bikeshare Data

### Description
For this project, I chose to use Python to investigate data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The code will import the data from these files and respond to questions by utilizing descriptive statistics. This will also include a script that takes in raw input and create an interactive experience for the user.

### Files used
